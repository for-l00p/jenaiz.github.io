I was working for almost 9 years in Spain before to arrive on Germany. There, I started as a Software Engineer and when I left Spain, I was Project Manager &amp; Software Architect. Along those years I have learnt a lot and apply my knowledge in the projects that I have been working. From Telecom companies to Banking... from Web applications to Grid Computing.

At the beginning of 2013 I moved to Germany to discover how "germans build things". In the lasts times I have been working in two Startups, because not always startups success :). And of course I am learning Deutsch to understand the german <em>"Sinn f√ºr Humor"</em>.

<strong>Interests</strong>

large scale distributed systems, parallel computing and machine learning.
